PREREQUISITES: 
- Run yolosetup.sh if you don't meet the prerequisites
- Have pip, git installed
- Run python3 make_dataset.py -folder "<folder name>" (ask about this one)
- Be in the directory that contains yoloscript.sh before calling it

Directory Structure:

<main folder>   - yoloscript.sh
                - yolohelp.txt (this)
                - vision        - datasets
                                - models        - standard      - image_resizer.py
                                                                - requirements.txt
                                                                - yolov5m.yaml

BEFORE EACH RUN:
- jpg images in new folder <folder name>
- downloaded <folder name>.zip to Downloads folder (yolotxts from v7labs)

IMPLEMENTATION:
- bash yoloscript.sh "<folder name>" <# of epochs> "<weighting>" "<object #1>" "<object #2 (etc.)>"
- If you aren't using any weighting, just enter empty quotes: ""
- yoloscript will take any number of classes/objects greater than 0
- run the following command to use camera (after plugging it in) once the script is done:


FOR TEST:
bash yoloscript.sh "redbulltest" 100 "" "redbull"
python3 vision/models/redbulltest/yolov5/detect.py --weights vision/models/redbulltest/model.pt --data vision/models/redbulltest/yolov5/data/data.yaml --source 0
